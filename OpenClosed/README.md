## Open Closed Principle

- Closed for modification, open for extension
- Once a class is in production it should not change
- A class should only be changed if there is a bug in the system
- OCP doesn't apply as much during development as things are constantly changing
- If it's not broke, don't introduce new bugs that could break it
- Best way to implement OCP is to not directly tie ourselves to classes, use interfaces

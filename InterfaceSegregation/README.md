## Interface Segregation Principle

- A client should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use
- By creating combination interfaces, we gain access to all the desired behaviour and don't need to cast
- Favour small interfaces that can be combined rather than single large ones
- This keeps our application more flexible when it comes to future changes
